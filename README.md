Prediction Daiabetes Dataset Using Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
Business Problem¶
It is a desired develope a machine learning model that can predict people have diabetes when characterisitics are specified.

Dataset Story¶
About this dataset:This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage
